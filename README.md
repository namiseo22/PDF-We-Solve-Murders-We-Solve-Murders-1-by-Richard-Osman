An iconic new detective duo. And a puzzling new murder to solve...Steve Wheeler is enjoying retired life.

His days of adventure are over: adrenaline is daughter-in-law Amy?s business now.Amy Wheeler thinks adrenaline is good for the soul. As a private security officer, she doesn?t stay still long enough for habits or routines. She?s currently on a remote island keeping world-famous author Rosie D?Antonio alive. Which was meant to be an easy job...Then a dead body, a bag of money, and a killer with their sights on Amy have her sending an SOS to the only person she trusts. A breakneck race around the world begins, but can Amy and Steve stay one step ahead of a lethal enemy?</p>
